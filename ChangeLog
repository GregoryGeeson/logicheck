1.0 (2015)

Initial release with the core functionality that remains largely unchanged up
to version 2.1. Included the ability to add a series of premises (logical
expressions) and a conclusion to form a deductive argument. The program would
then determine the logical validity of the argument; if invalid, a list of
counterexamples that provided proof of invalidity was shown. At any time,
the user could reset to return the program to its initial state.
